# A JavaScript Drumkit

## Project Description

In this project, I developed a fun website drumkit that allows users to click on a button and generate a corresponding sound. The implementation was executed using a javascript switch statement, which detects the key or button click and triggers the corresponding sound effect.

The primary objective of this project was to leverage javascript as the sole means to drive all actions on the website. While this approach was relatively more challenging than using CSS for hover animation, I utilized online resources such as StackOverflow to craft a simple javascript function for adding a class to the element.

Rather than pushing my limits, the aim of this project was to revisit and reinforce my prior knowledge acquired nearly two years ago. While it is crucial to acquire new skills, it is equally important not to overlook the fundamentals.
